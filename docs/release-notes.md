## 0.9.x

### 0.9.3

- The probability of edge cases being generated is now higher
- New constraint annotation `@NotEmpty`

  component type arbitrary

  arbitrary for value generation
- Added [`Arbitraries.frequencyOf()`](#randomly-choosing-among-arbitraries)

- Integral number generation generates a few more edge cases
- You can use `@Size` to [constrain the generation](#number-of-actions)
  of `ActionSequence` parameters
- Some incompatible changes to the `ActionSequence` interface
- jqwik.jar does no longer deliver a jqwik.properties file in its classpath
- jqwik logs WARNING if unsupported property is used in
  `jqwik.properties` file

  `defaultAfterFailure'
- Introduced [`@Property(afterFailure)`](#rerunning-falsified-properties)
- `ArbitraryConfiguratorBase` has new method `acceptType(TypeUsage)`,
  which can be overridden.
- Added two new after-failure-modes: `SAMPLE_ONLY` and `SAMPLE_FIRST`
- Action sequences for state-based properties are serializable now
  in order to enable `SAMPLE_ONLY` and `SAMPLE_FIRST`

### 0.9.2

- Exhaustive generation works for ambiguous arbitrary resolution if each arbitrary
  can be generated exhaustively
- Fixed bug related to correct throwable propagation when shrinking
- Erroneous properties will also be shrunk now

### 0.9.1

- Container shrinking tries one more thing to get smaller results

  of same arbitrary.

- Implemented exhaustive generation for `Arbitraries.frequency()`
- Changed display name of test engine to "jqwik for Java"

  because Gradle does not support it yet
- Using JUnit platform reporter [can now be configured](#jqwik-configuration)

  in favour of `net.jqwik.api.Tuple.*`
- There are new tuple types `Tuple5` up to `Tuple8`
- [Data-Driven Properties:](#data-driven-properties) Feed data into your properties
  instead of randomized generation
- Display names of test containers and properties
  [will now automatically be prettified](#naming-and-labeling-tests),
  i.e. each underscore will be replaced by a single space.

## 0.8.x

### 0.8.15

- `StringArbitrary.withChars()` now accepts varargs.
- Added `StringArbitrary.whitespace()`
- Added `@Whitespace` annotation
- Improved shrinking of action sequences
- Default String generation does no longer generate Unicode "noncharacters"
  or "private use characters"
- Added `StringArbitrary.all()` for also generating
  Unicode "noncharacters" and "private use characters"

### 0.8.14

- Some potentially incompatible stuff has changed for
  [default arbitrary providers](#providing-default-arbitraries):
  - Introduced `ArbitraryProvider.priority()`
  - The old `ArbitraryProvider.provideFor(TypeUsage, Function)` is now deprecated, override
    `ArbitraryProvider.provideFor(TypeUsage, SubtypeProvider)` instead
  - If more than one provider fits a given type, one of the will be
    chosen randomly
- `Arbitraries.defaultFor()` will randomly choose one arbitrary if
  there is more than one fitting registered arbitrary provider

### 0.8.13

Faulty release. Do not use!

### 0.8.12

- Implemented generic type resolution to enable [contract tests](#contract-tests)
- Renamed `GenericType` to `TypeUsage`
  <p/>_This is an incompatible API change!_

### 0.8.11

- Reporting with `Reporting.FALSIFIED` now reports much less, and hopefully no wrong values anymore.
- Shrinking with filtered values finds simpler values in some circumstance
- Generation of strings will allow any unicode character by default
- `Combinators.combine()` can now take a list of arbitraries of same return type.
- Generated edge cases are now injected again and again and not only in the beginning.
- Complete re-implementation of shrinking with a few implications:
  - Shrinking should work better and more efficient overall. There might
    be situations, though, in which shrinking does no longer find
    the simplest example.
  - `ShrinkingMode.BOUNDED` might interrupt shrinking with completely different results.
  - When using `Reporting.FALSIFIED` you will see different inbetween
    shrinking steps that before.
  - The public interface of `Shrinkable` has changed in an incompatible way,
    but that shouldn't affect anyone but myself.


### 0.8.10

- Fixed shrinking bug that could result in integers not being shrunk
  as far as possible
- Integer shrinking should be faster in most cases and cover more cases

### 0.8.9
