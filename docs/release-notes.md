## 1.3.3-SNAPSHOT

#### New and Enhanced Features

- Shrinking has been re-implemented from scratch. Should be more predictable and 
  shrink to smaller samples in most cases.

- Shrinking now has stronger equivalence requirements for falsification:
  - Same type of assertion error or other exception
  - Assertion error or exception thrown from the same code location

- Negative numbers are shrunk to their positive counterpart if possible

- Changes in property result reporting: 
    - Shrunk samples have now header line "Shrunk Sample (<n> steps)"
    - If no shrinking took place samples have header line "Sample"
    - Original samples now also report the original error
    - Action sequences in stateful properties got their own reporting format

#### Breaking Changes

- Exceeding shrinking bound is now logged as warning instead of being reported
  through JUnit platform reporting
  
- Deprecated interface `net.jqwik.api.ShrinkingSequence`. Throw all your implementations away!

- Deprecated class `net.jqwik.api.FalsificationResult`. No longer used anywhere.

- Deprecated method `Shrinkable.shrink(Falsifier<T> falsifier)`. 
  It's no longer used anywhere.

  [JUnit 5 platform reporting](/docs/1.3.2/user-guide.html#platform-reporting-with-reporter-object)

#### Bug Fixes

- Reporting samples with circular dependencies [does no longer throw
  an exception](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/111)

- Reporting test failure due to exception without message 
  no longer leads to ignored test

  [has been completely reworked](/docs/1.3.1/user-guide.html#failure-reporting).
  See [this issue](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/85) for more details.

- Added `Arbitrary.ignoreException(exceptionType)` which allows to
  [ignore exceptions during value generation](/docs/1.3.1/user-guide.html#ignoring-exceptions-during-generation).

- You can now influence the 
  [distribution of random number generation](/docs/1.3.0/user-guide.html#random-numeric-distribution): 
  All numeric arbitraries now support `withDistribution(RandomDistribution)`
  to choose between `RandomDistribution.biased()` (default),
   `RandomDistribution.uniform()` and `RandomDistribution.gaussian(borderSigma)`. 
  
- Default number generation has now a much higher bias towards numbers
  that are closer to the shrinking target of a number range.

- Set `Arbitrary.exhaustive()` to API status `INTERNAL`

- Set `ExhaustiveGenerator` and all its methods to API status `INTERNAL`

- The evaluation order of `SkipExecutionHook` hooks can no longer be influenced.

  [the high probability generation of duplicate values](/docs/1.2.3/user-guide.html#inject-duplicate-values)

  in String and Character arbitraries - if it lies within the allowed character range.

  be called with same number of parameters.

  i.e. after statistics reports.

## 0.8.x

### 0.8.15

- `StringArbitrary.withChars()` now accepts varargs.
- Added `StringArbitrary.whitespace()`
- Added `@Whitespace` annotation
- Improved shrinking of action sequences
- Default String generation does no longer generate Unicode "noncharacters"
  or "private use characters"
- Added `StringArbitrary.all()` for also generating
  Unicode "noncharacters" and "private use characters"

### 0.8.14

- Some potentially incompatible stuff has changed for
  [default arbitrary providers](/docs/0.9.3/user-guide.html#providing-default-arbitraries):
  - Introduced `ArbitraryProvider.priority()`
  - The old `ArbitraryProvider.provideFor(TypeUsage, Function)` is now deprecated, override
    `ArbitraryProvider.provideFor(TypeUsage, SubtypeProvider)` instead
  - If more than one provider fits a given type, one of the will be
    chosen randomly
- `Arbitraries.defaultFor()` will randomly choose one arbitrary if
  there is more than one fitting registered arbitrary provider

### 0.8.13

Faulty release. Do not use!

### 0.8.12

- Implemented generic type resolution to enable [contract tests](/docs/0.9.3/user-guide.html#contract-tests)
- Renamed `GenericType` to `TypeUsage`
  <p/>_This is an incompatible API change!_

### 0.8.11

- Reporting with `Reporting.FALSIFIED` now reports much less, and hopefully no wrong values anymore.

- `Combinators.combine()` can now take a list of arbitraries of same return type.
- Generated edge cases are now injected again and again and not only in the beginning.
- Complete re-implementation of shrinking with a few implications:
  - Shrinking should work better and more efficient overall. There might
    be situations, though, in which shrinking does no longer find
    the simplest example.
  - `ShrinkingMode.BOUNDED` might interrupt shrinking with completely different results.
  - When using `Reporting.FALSIFIED` you will see different inbetween
    shrinking steps that before.
  - The public interface of `Shrinkable` has changed in an incompatible way,
    but that shouldn't affect anyone but myself.


### 0.8.10

  as far as possible
- Integer shrinking should be faster in most cases and cover more cases
